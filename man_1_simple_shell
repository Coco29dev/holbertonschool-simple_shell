.SH SYNOPSIS
.B SIMPLE SHELL
#include"shell.h"
int main(void)

.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell -- The main shell loop that reads commands and executes them.

The code represents the main loop of a shell that reads user commands, splits them into arguments, and executes them.
If the input is valid, it is tokenized and checked to determine if it's a built-in command or not. If it's a built-in command,
it's executed; otherwise, the shell uses 'execmd' to run the command. After each execution, the memory allocated for the arguments is freed,
and the process repeats until the user exits or reading fails. Finally, the memory allocated for the input line is also freed 
before exiting cleanly.


.SH RETURN VALUE
The main function returns 0 to indicate that the program has terminated normally. This means that the shell was executed without error and 
the execution ended cleanly, either after the main loop finishes following user input or if reading the input fails.
